## Getting Started

Welcome to this project. If you want to run this project local. Make sure you got a Java Compiler, else you aren't able to run this project. Remember, when you are running with your IDE, add the .jar files to your Referenced Libraries.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default. The built jar file will be in the `Jar Build` folder.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
